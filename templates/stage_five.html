		<h2>Stage 5.1 Meet JavaScript</h2>

		<div class="concept" id="stage-5-1-1">
			<div class="concept-title">Introduction to JavaScript</div>
			<div class="concept-content"><p>This lesson is here for two reasons:</p>
			<p>1. To introduce JavaScript, the programming language of the web.</p>
			<p>2. To quickly refresh and review programming concepts like variables and data types.</p>
			<p>The instructions say that we're free to browse this lesson however we'd like. We can follow along or just watch the videos because the end goal is awareness.</p>
			<p>I like to follow along with the examples the instructors are using because it increases my comprehension and retention. I had trouble at first because the lesson never explicitly says what we are supposed to be editing and what file we are supposed to be looking at in the browser. I posted to the Udacity forums and found out some important things:</p>
			<p>To follow along, you first need to clone the repository at <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/udacity/frontend-nanodegree-resume">https://github.com/udacity/frontend-nanodegree-resume</a>. If you need help doing that, I recommend the Udacity course <a target="_blank" href="https://www.udacity.com/course/how-to-use-git-and-github--ud775">How to Use Git and GitHub</a>. The course says it takes three weeks but I completed it in about 8 hours, so it won't take very long. Plus, Git is incredibly useful at this point in the Nanodegree as you make major experimental changes in your final project.</p>
			<p>Second, when the instructors have you input code, input it into the <code>resumeBuilder.js</code> file found in your newly cloned repository. The file we should be viewing in the browser for output is the <code>index.html</code> file found in the root directory of the repository.</p></div>
		</div>

		<div class="concept" id="stage-5-1-2">
			<div class="concept-title">Adding JavaScript to a Page</div>
			<div class="concept-content"><p>There are two ways:</p>
			<p>1. Put the JavaScript directly into your html file.</p>
			<p>Add the JavaScript inside of <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> tags. <a target="_blank" href="http://www.w3schools.com/js/tryit.asp?filename=tryjs_whereto_head">This example</a> shows how.</p>
			<p>2. Put the JavaScript in a separate <code>.js</code> file.</p>
			<p>This is the preferred method because it keeps your JavaScript separate from your HTML, making things cleaner, more organized and easier to edit, plus you can use the same script for many files. <a target="_blank" href="http://javascript.info/tutorial/adding-script-html#external-scripts">This tutorial</a> shows you how.</p></div>
		</div>

		<div class="concept" id="stage-5-1-3">
			<div class="concept-title">var loveJS = true;</div>
			<div class="concept-content"><p>JavaScript runs natively in the browser and allows us to run and inspect our code very easily.</p>
			<p>JavaScript gives us a way of saving data in the form of variables.</p>
			<p>The syntax looks like this: <code>var {{variableName}} = {{someValue}}</code>.</p>
			<p>To declare a new variable, you begin with the keyword <code>var</code>, regardless of the datatype you're saving.</p>
			<p>In this example, <code>var firstName = &quot;james&quot;;</code>, we're creating a variable, <code>firstName</code>, and assigning it the string <code>&quot;james&quot;</code>.</p>
			<p>Assigning variables is slightly different than in Python, which doesn't require a keyword like <code>var</code>, but otherwise looks the same.</p>
			<p>Numbers in JS don't need quotes, and you don't need to worry about the differences between floating point numbers and integers, as all numbers are saved as 64 bit floating point.</p>
			<p>Later on, we'll see that arrays, functions and objects use the same <code>var</code> syntax.</p>
			<p>Lets see if our variables are actually being saved. Add these lines to resumeBuilder.js:</p>
<pre><code>var firstName = &quot;james&quot;;
var age = 32;
console.log(firstName);</code></pre>
			<p>Then reload index.html in the browser. Open up the console. (In Chrome, its viewable via Developer Tools) <code>james</code> has printed out to the console. If the browser opens up a script with <code>console.log</code> in it, it will print whatever information it recieves to the browser console. Its very useful for debugging.</p></div>
		</div>

		<div class="concept" id="stage-5-1-4">
			<div class="concept-title">string.replace()</div>
			<div class="concept-content"><p>To build our resumes, we'll be using the <code>string.replace</code> method to find a pattern in a string to replace all or some matches of it.</p>
			<p><code>[string].replace([old], [new])</code></p>
			<p>Example:</p>
<pre><code>var email = &quot;cameron@udacity.com&quot;;
var newEmail = email.replace(&quot;udacity&quot;, &quot;gmail&quot;);
console.log(email);
console.log(newEmail);</code></pre>
			<p>With this example, you can see in the console that Cameron's old udacity email has been replaced with a gmail account.</p>
			<p>Another example using <code>.append</code> to output to the browser:</p>
<pre><code>var awesomeThoughts = &quot;I am JP and I am AWESOME!&quot;;
var funThoughts = awesomeThoughts.replace(&quot;AWESOME!&quot;, &quot;FUN&quot;);
$(&quot;#main&quot;).append(funThoughts);</code></pre></div>
		</div>

		<div class="concept" id="stage-5-1-5">
			<div class="concept-title">Mixing .replace() and .append()</div>
			<div class="concept-content"><p>HTML defines the content of a page. Now that we can replace text, we can replace text with real data, and append HTML strings to start building our resume.</p>
			<p>Lets look inside <code>helper.js</code>. It contains some helper data that your project will take advantage of. Because <code>helper.js</code> shows up in the HTML before <code>resumeBuilder.js</code>, it will load first and we'll have access to all the data from <code>helper.js</code> when we start writing <code>resumeBuilder.js</code>. In <code>helper.js</code>, we can see a few string variables, like <code>HTMLmobile</code>, <code>HTMLemail</code>, and <code>HTMLtwitter</code>. Each of them has a <code>%data%</code> placeholder. In each of those we'll be replacing <code>%data%</code> with our actual data. We'll replace <code>%data%</code> the same way we replaced AWESOME with FUN.</p>
			<p>Lets try it with the resume:</p>
<pre><code>var name = &quot;Jean-Paul Lacy&quot;;
var formattedName = HTMLheaderName.replace(&quot;%data%&quot;, name);
var role = &quot;Web Developer&quot;;
var formattedRole = HTMLheaderRole.replace(&quot;%data%&quot;, role);
$(&quot;#header&quot;).prepend(formattedRole);
$(&quot;#header&quot;).prepend(formattedName);</code></pre>
			<p>We use <code>.prepend</code> in this case because the header div in <code>index.html</code> already has content that we want to come after our name and role.</p></div>
		</div>

		<div class="concept" id="stage-5-1-6">
			<div class="concept-title">String Manipulation</div>
			<div class="concept-content"><p> Using string methods, convert &quot;audacity&quot; to &quot;Udacity&quot;. Look at the documentation on JS string methods <a target="_blank" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String">here</a>.</p>
<pre><code>var s = &quot;audacity&quot;;
var udacityizer = function(s) {
	var s = &quot;audacity&quot;;
	s = s[1].toUpperCase() + s.slice(2);
	return s;
};
console.log(udacityizer(s));</code></pre></div>
		</div>

		<div class="concept" id="stage-5-1-7">
			<div class="concept-title">Truthy/Falsy</div>
			<div class="concept-content"><p>JS has a set of values that may evaluate to true or false but may not equal true or false. Because of this, we call these values truthy and falsy.</p>
			<p><strong>Truthy:</strong></p>
			<p>true</p>
			<p>non-zero numbers</p>
			<p>&quot;strings with a length of at least one&quot;</p>
			<p>objects</p>
			<p>arrays</p>
			<p>functions</p>
			<p>(all evaluate to true)</p>
			<p><strong>Falsy:</strong></p>
			<p>false</p>
			<p>0</p>
			<p>&quot;&quot;(empty strings)</p>
			<p>undefined(The variable doesn't exist, the interpreter doesn't know what you're referring to.)</p>
			<p>null(The variable exists, but has no value.)</p>
			<p>NaN(Not a Number)</p>
			<p>(all evaluate to false)</p></div>
		</div>

		<div class="concept" id="stage-5-1-8">
			<div class="concept-title">Arrays</div>
			<div class="concept-content"><p>JS arrays are 0 index, just like lists Python. The first element is indexed to 0.</p>
			<p>Arrays are just lists of values, and the behave just like lists in Python.</p>
			<p>Syntax: <code>var myArray = [item_1, item_n]</code></p>
			<p>Lets make an array of skills, it could be useful in our resumes:</p>
			<p><code>var skills = [&quot;awesomeness&quot;, &quot;programming&quot;, &quot;teaching&quot;, &quot;JS&quot;];</code></p>
			<p>$<code>(&quot;#main&quot;).append(skills);</code></p>
			<p>Save that in <code>resumeBuilder.js</code> and refresh <code>index.html</code>. It displays, but without commas or spaces, because our strings didn't include them.</p>
			<p>Now add the line <code>$(&quot;#main&quot;).append(skills[0]);</code> to <code>resumeBuilder.js</code>. The word awesomeness gets added to what we have in the browser.</p>
			<p>If you want to just display awesomeness, comment out the first append line.</p>
			<p>Is the length of an array equal to the last index? No. Indexing starts at 0 for the first item in an array.</p></div>
		</div>

		<div class="concept" id="stage-5-1-9">
			<div class="concept-title">Array Manipulation</div>
			<div class="concept-content"><p>If you are given an array of numbers, how can you increase the value of the last number by one?</p>
<pre><code>function incrementLastArrayElement(_array)  {
	var newArray = [];
	newArray = _array.slice(0);
	var lastNumber = newArray.pop();
	newArray.push(lastNumber + 1);
	return newArray;
}</code></pre></div>
		</div>

		<div class="concept" id="stage-5-1-10">
			<div class="concept-title">Object Literal Notation</div>
			<div class="concept-content"><p>Hands are like objects because they can hold information and do things.</p>
			<p>Objects in JS can be declared and defined in a few different ways.</p>
			<p>All of them are different from the say Python defines classes and objects because there are no classes in JS. There are ways to mimic classes in some respects, but they are still just objects.</p>
			<p>Lets start defining objects with Object Literal Notation. It uses the same <code>var</code> syntax we had before:</p>
			<p><code>var myObj = {};</code></p>
			<p>Lets define an object from the biography:</p>
			<p><code>var bio = {};</code></p>
			<p>Inside the curly braces, we can define the object's properties using key value pairs:</p>
<pre><code>var bio = {
	&quot;name&quot; : &quot;James&quot;,
	&quot;age&quot; : 32
	&quot;skills&quot; : skills
};</code></pre>
			<p>We can save whatever we want here, even an array like skills.</p>
			<p>To access these properties later, we add <code>.property</code> after the object name.</p>
			<p>To append James' name to the page, all you need to do is access the <code>.name</code> property:</p>
			<p><code>$(&quot;#main&quot;).append(bio.name);</code></p></div>
		</div>

		<div class="concept" id="stage-5-1-11">
			<div class="concept-title">Dot and Bracket Notation</div>
			<div class="concept-content"><p>We just used dot notation for objects, which we just used to access <code>bio.name</code>.</p>
			<p>Dot notation allows us to define an object, then define its properties outside the curly braces:</p>
			<p><code>Syntax: var myObj = {};</code></p>
			<p><code>myObj.property = someValue;</code></p>
			<p>Example:</p>
<pre><code>var bio = {
	&quot;name&quot; : &quot;James&quot;,
	&quot;age&quot; : 32
	&quot;skills&quot; : skills
};
bio.city = &quot;Mountain View&quot;;
bio.email = &quot;james.williams@udacity.com&quot;</code></pre>
			<p>With dot notation, there is no need to use var. We're adding properties to an object, not creating new variables.</p>
			<p>There is at least one more syntax pattern to define the properties of an object: Bracket notation.</p>
			<p>Syntax: <code>myObj[&quot;property&quot;]=someValue</code></p>
			<p>Example:</p>
<pre><code>bio [&quot;city&quot;] = &quot;Mountain View&quot;;
bio [&quot;email&quot;] = &quot;james.williams@udacity.com&quot;</code></pre></div>
		</div>

		<div class="concept" id="stage-5-1-12">
			<div class="concept-title">A Note about JSON</div>
			<div class="concept-content"><p>What is JSON?</p>
			<p>JavaScript Object Notation. Its a simple format for storing and transferring nested hierarchical data. Most other programming languages have libraries to parse and write JSON. GET and POST requests often communicate using JSON. JSON allows for objects and data of other types to be enclosed in other objects.</p>
			<p>Why should I lint my JSON?</p>
			<p>JSON uses a mix of nested curly braces, brackets and commas, so its easy to make errors, creating bugs. If you're writing JSON by hand, you should run your code through a JSON linter to find syntax errors. <a target="_blank" href="http://jsonlint.com/">jsonlint.com</a> is a good one.</p>
			<p>Sublime text will highlight most syntax errors, but a JSON linter won't miss any.</p></div>
		</div>

		<div class="concept" id="stage-5-1-13">
			<div class="concept-title">JSON</div>
			<div class="concept-content"><p>JSON relies on object literal notation, useful for storing nested data.</p>
			<p>Example:</p>
<pre><code>var education = {
	&quot;schools&quot;: [
		{
		&quot;name&quot;: &quot;Eckerd College&quot;,
		&quot;city&quot;: &quot;Saint Petersburg&quot;,
		&quot;degree&quot;: &quot;BA&quot;,
		&quot;major&quot;: [&quot;CompSci&quot;, &quot;French&quot;]
		},
		{
		&quot;name&quot;: &quot;Nova Southeastern University&quot;,
		&quot;city&quot;: &quot;Fort Lauderdale&quot;,
		&quot;degree&quot;: &quot;Masters&quot;,
		&quot;major&quot;: [&quot;CompSci&quot;]
		}
	]
}</code></pre></div>
		</div>

		<div class="concept" id="stage-5-1-14">
			<div class="concept-title">Validating JSON</div>
			<div class="concept-content"><p>Open up <a target="_blank" href="http://jsonlint.com/">jsonlint.com</a> which will tell us if the above JSON is in the right format. Go ahead and copy the object above, just between the curly braces.</p>
			<p>Paste it in, click validate, and the results say Valid JSON.</p></div>

		<h2>Stage 5.2 The Power of APIs</h2>

		<div class="concept" id="stage-5-2-1">
			<div class="concept-title">Introduction</div>
			<div class="concept-content"><p>We're going to talk about how to make your website communicate with other computers, by using what we call an API (Application Programming Interface.) Instead of generating HTML that we send to browsers, we're going to get data in formats like XML or JSON which are designed to be read by computers. In this lesson, we're going to add a feature to ASCII Chan that will allow you to see where users are submitting images from using the Google Maps API.</p></div>
		</div>

		<div class="concept" id="stage-5-2-2">
			<div class="concept-title">HTTP Clients</div>
			<div class="concept-content"><p>Until now, we've been working with the standard picture of the user, their browser, and servers. In a normal web request, the user makes a request to the server, and we respond with the response. What we're going to be talking about is when your servers make requests to other servers. We can have a web page that actually makes requests to Twitter. These are our servers talking to theirs. They're still communicating over HTTP, and Twitter still responds as usual. If we're writing a web program that does some data analysis on Twitter, a user might make a request to us, we might make a request to Twitter, they respond, we may manipulate that data and return it to the user. This is actually a really common case.</p>
			<p>Hipmunk does a lot of this. When a user does a flight search, what Hipmunk does is hit a bunch of data providers where they actually get their flight data from. Hipmunk will take your flight search, send it to ITA, send it to an airline, and in some cases, even send it to Amtrak, ITA will run their flight search and send Hipmunk data back, the airline will do the same, and Amtrak will do the same as well. On Hipmunk's server, they have all this flight search data. They will manipulate all the data, collate it, make nice results, and send back an HTML response to the user.</p>
			<p>What we're going to be working on is how do we make our server speak to other servers, when there's no browser involved. We're still using HTTP, but we are now communicating over other protocols. There are a lot of cool things you can do when you realize you aren't the only service on the internet.</p></div>
		</div>

		<div class="concept" id="stage-5-2-3">
			<div class="concept-title">Urllib</div>
			<div class="concept-content"><p>In Python we have a library called <code>urllib2</code>. (And a library called <code>urllib</code>.) Open a Python terminal and import both of those.</p>
			<p><code>urllib2</code> has a function called <code>urlopen.</code> Type this line into the terminal: <code>p = urllib2.urlopen(&quot;http://www.google.com&quot;)</code></p>
			<p>Now if we type <code>p</code> in the terminal, we get something like: <code>&lt;addinfourl at 42571208L whose fp = &lt;socket._fileobject object at 0x0000000002466B10&gt;&gt;</code></p>
			<p>This is basically a file object. In Python, a file object is an object with a <code>read</code> method. You can call <code>read</code> on it to get the contents.</p>
			<p>Type this line into the terminal: <code>c = p.read()</code></p>
			<p>Now, type in <code>c</code>. We get a wall of text. This is actually Google's front page. Now we can manipulate the response in our programs.</p>
			<p>Now, lets look at the <code>p</code> object. Type in <code>dir(p)</code>. Now we can see the methods and attributes on our <code>p</code> object.</p>
			<p>Lets look at a couple of them: Type in <code>p.url</code>. We get <code>'http://www.google.com'</code>.</p>
			<p>Type in <code>p.headers</code>. We get something like <code>&lt;httplib.HTTPMessage instance at 0x0000000002899288&gt;</code>. This is an HTTP message instance. This happens to be a dictionary. So if we type in <code>p.headers.items()</code>, we can see all the headers we got back from Google.</p></div>
		</div>

		<div class="concept" id="stage-5-2-4">
			<div class="concept-title">XML</div>
			<div class="concept-content"><p>How computers communicate:</p>
			<p>We could have our servers (say Hipmunk,) make a request to Amtrak and receive HTML back from them. But, this is sub-optimal. HTML is somewhat complex, its not very regular, browsers are forgiving of errors, and parsing HTML by machine is very difficult, so HTML is not an ideal language for computer to computer communication.</p>
			<p>One such language is XML. XML was invented in the late 90s expressly for this purpose, to have a regular way of expressing data between computer systems. XML is very similar to HTML. The main difference between XML and HTML is that every tag must have a closing tag. The tag format is the same, we still have less than and greater than surrounding tags, and slashes to indicate closing tags. There are no void tags in XML.</p></div>
		</div>

		<div class="concept" id="stage-5-2-5">
			<div class="concept-title">Parsing XML</div>
			<div class="concept-content"><p>Python has a library called <code>minidom</code>. You can get it by saying <code>from xml.dom import minidom</code>. dom stands for Document Object Model. This refers to the internal representation of an XML document. We'll be using <code>minidom</code>. Why is it called that? The mini implies that its a smaller, lighter weight version of this dom parser. When you're only parsing a little text, you can use the library <code>minidom</code>, which is simple and fast, but will break if you throw lots of gigabytes of text at it.</p>
			<p><code>minidom</code> has a function called <code>parseString: minidom.parseString</code></p>
			<p>Try entering this: <code>x = minidom.parseString(&quot;&lt;mytag&gt;contents!&lt;children&gt;&lt;item&gt;1&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;2&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/children&gt;&lt;/mytag&gt;&quot;)</code></p>
			<p>Then do <code>dir(x)</code>. We get a ton of stuff back.</p>
			<p>Try print <code>x.toprettyxml()</code>. We get a nicely formatted version of our string.</p>
			<p>Try <code>x.getElementsByTagName(&quot;mytag&quot;)</code>. We get one item.</p>
			<p>Try <code>x.getElementsByTagName(&quot;item&quot;)</code>. We get two items.</p>
			<p>We can look at the first item element by doing <code>x.getElementsByTagName(&quot;item&quot;)[0]</code></p>
			<p>If we look at its children, <code>x.getElementsByTagName(&quot;item&quot;)[0].childNodes</code>, we get <code>[&lt;DOM Text node &quot;u'1'&quot;&gt;]</code>, which means we have one text node.</p>
			<p><code>x.getElementsByTagName(&quot;item&quot;)[0].childNodes[0].nodeValue</code> accesses the node value attribute, which tells us the value is 1.</p></div>
		</div>

		<div class="concept" id="stage-5-2-6">
			<div class="concept-title">JSON</div>
			<div class="concept-content"><p>JSON serves the same purpose as XML, which is that its a nice computer and human readable way to exchange data. It stands for JavaScript Object Notation. JSON is actually valid JavaScript code. It basically looks like a dictionary:</p>
<pre><code>{&quot;itineraries&quot;: [{&quot;from&quot;: &quot;SFO&quot;,
				  &quot;to&quot;: &quot;IAD&quot;},
				 {&quot;from&quot;: &quot;IAD&quot;,
				  &quot;to&quot;: &quot;SEA&quot;}]
}</code></pre>
			<p>We have a dictionary, its got a key called itineraries, whose value may be a list of other dictionaries. In this case, we have a dictionary for each leg.</p>
			<p>JSON is really handy for expressing these types of objects. Anything you can express in XML, you can also express in JSON. JSON is a little less verbose because you don't need opening and closing tags. You can build things out of dictionaries, you can also have lists, which use brackets just like Python does, a list can also be the value of a dictionary, or an item in a list.</p>
			<p>How to parse JSON in Python:</p>
			<p>In your Python terminal <code>import json</code>.</p>
			<p>Enter this: <code>j = '{&quot;one&quot;: 1, &quot;numbers&quot;: [1,2,3.5]}</code>'</p>
			<p>Now, lets parse the string: <code>json.loads(j)</code></p>
			<p>When we run that, we get back a Python dictionary with our same keys and our same values: <code>{u'numbers': [1, 2, 3.5], u'one': 1}</code></p>
			<p>If we store that in a variable like this: <code>d = json.loads(j)</code></p>
			<p>We can manipulate it like this: <code>d['numbers']</code> gives us our list, and <code>d['one']</code> gives us our number 1.</p></div>

			<div class="concept-content"><p>On Reddit, we can get any page in JSON or XML by changing the extension to .json or .xml respectively. Many web pages have this feature, where you can get their content in different formats.</p>
			<p>Another good example is Twitter. If you go to Twitter and do a search for Udacity, you'll get all the different tweets about Udacity. Instead, if you go to search.twitter.com/seach.json?=udacity, you'll get a json listing of the search results we were just looking at.</p>

			<div class="concept-content"><p>How to be a good citizen on the internet:</p>
			<p>There are two key things you can do when writing software that accesses other people's websites.</p>
			<p>1. Use a good user-agent. User-agents are the header that describes the browser or software you're using to access somebody. If you're planning to access somebody in a consistent fashion, use a good user agent. When you're using <code>urllib2</code>, you can specify headers in your request, and you should set a user agent header that says who you are, what your name is, maybe links to your website, so if someone on the other end sees you pounding them, they have a way of reaching you to ask you to tone it down.</p>
			<p>2. Rate limit yourself. Instead of hammering sites for more and more results, its a good idea to get in the habit of using the <code>sleep</code> function so you aren't stressing someone's server.</p></div>

			<div class="concept-content"><p>First, you need to download and unzip the file ascii-chan-ipnd-incomplete from <a target="_blank" href="https://www.udacity.com/course/viewer#!/c-nd000/l-4191238688/m-4080748764">here</a>, then you can follow along with the rest of the lesson.</p>
			<p>ASCII Chan is a website that allows users to submit a title along with ascii art in a message board format. Once I had it downloaded and unzipped, I loaded it in GAE so I could see it working on my machine.</p>
			<p>What we'd like to do is add a map that shows where the most recent submissions came from.</p>
			<p>We need to do several things to get this map working:</p>
			<p>We need a way to turn the request IP into coordinates.</p>
			<p>(For this we'll be using hostip.info, which has a handy API.)</p>
			<p>We need a way to draw a map.</p>
			<p>(For this we'll be using Google Maps, which has a service called static maps, which lets us draw a map with markers on it.)</p></div>
		</div>

		<div class="concept" id="stage-5-2-11">
			<div class="concept-title">Geolocation</div>
			<div class="concept-content"><p>Lets start with the first piece: Implementing a function that looks up the user's ip.</p>
			<p>Look at the code for ASCII Chan in the folder you unzipped. Its in <code>main.py</code>. Its not a lot of code, and most of it is taken up by the main page handler. The <code>get</code> function function just calls <code>render_front</code>. All <code>render_front</code> does is run a basic query to get the 10 most recent pieces of art. The <code>post</code> function grabs the title and art, and if we have both of them, creates a new art object and puts it in the database, then reloads the page by doing a redirect, otherwise it sends an error message to the user.</p>
			<p>What we're going to do, right after we create our art object is put in some comments:</p>
			<p><code># lookup the user coordinates from their IP.</code></p>
			<p><code># if we have coordinates, add them to the Art.</code></p>
			<p>We're going to need a function, we'll put it at the top just before <code>class Art</code>.</p>
<pre><code>def get_coords(ip):
	pass</code></pre>
			<p>This function will take an ip, and make a request to hostip.info, which will look like this:</p>
<pre><code>IP_URL = &quot;http://api.hostip.info/?ip=&quot;
def get_coords(ip):
	url = IP_URL + ip</code></pre>
			<p>We are going to be requesting the URL using <code>urllib2</code>, so go ahead and import that at the top of the program.</p>
			<p>We are going to be parsing the XML response using <code>minidom</code>, so go ahead and import that: from <code>xml.dom import minidom</code>.</p>
			<p>Go back to your <code>get_coords</code> function. Add some lines to store the url in a variable:</p>
<pre><code>IP_URL = &quot;http://api.hostip.info/?ip=&quot;
def get_coords(ip):
	url = IP_URL + ip
	content = None
	content = urllib2.urlopen(url)</code></pre>
			<p>Then we're going to call <code>read</code> on that response:</p>
			<p><code>content = urllib2.urlopen(url).read()</code></p>
			<p>If the URL is bad, or hostip.info is down, our code will raise an exception, so lets add code to deal with that:</p>
<pre><code>IP_URL = &quot;http://api.hostip.info/?ip=&quot;
def get_coords(ip):
	url = IP_URL + ip
	content = None
	try
		content = urllib2.urlopen(url).read()
	except URLError:
		return</code></pre>
			<p>We'll just return nothing, no coordinates. Normally, we might log this, so we can track whether or not geocoding is broken, but for our purposes we'll just return none.</p>
			<p>Next we want to check to see if there is actual content. If the website is broken it might not be giving us anything back:</p>
<pre><code>	if content:
		#parse the xml and find the coordinates
		pass</code></pre>
			<p>Now lets parse the content:</p>
<pre><code>	if content:
		d = minidom.parseString(content)
		coords = d.getElementsByTagName(&quot;gml:coordinates&quot;)
		if coords and coords[0].childNodes[0].nodeValue:
			lon, lat = coords[0].childNodes[0].nodeValue.split(',')
			return db.GeoPt(lat, lon)</code></pre>
			<p>The reason we return <code>db.GeoPt</code> is that its part of GAE, a data point for storing latitude and longitude.</p></div>
		</div>

		<div class="concept" id="stage-5-2-12">
			<div class="concept-title">Debugging</div>
			<div class="concept-content"><p>Lets test to see if our code is working. Add this line to <code>def get</code> before it calls <code>render_front():</code></p>
			<p><code>self.write(repr(get_coords(self.request.remote_addr)))</code></p>
			<p>First we call the function <code>write</code>, which outputs to the browser. Then we call <code>repr</code>. This is a handy trick for printing Python objects in HTML. When you print Python objects in HTML, it has angle brackets around them. <code>repr</code> makes them print properly. Then we call our function, <code>get_coords</code>, and call it with the requesting ip address <code>(self.request.remote_addr)</code>.</p>
			<p>When we save our code and reload the page, we see None at the top of the page. Thats better than an exception, but we didn't get a location.</p>
			<p>Lets do some investigation: First lets look at the actual ip address:</p>
<pre><code>	def get(self):
		self.write(self.request.remote_addr)
		self.write(repr(get_coords(self.request.remote_addr)))
		return self.render_front()</code></pre>
			<p>See what the browser returns now. 127.0.0.1. That means we're running this locally, so its not surprising that a service on the internet doesn't know what our local ip is. If we go to the hostip.info web page, it lists 127.0.0.1 as a private address. Every machine's local ip address is 127.0.0.1. This is called the loopback address and its how a machine refers to itself. Its not a public ip address on the internet. Localhost, which we're running our webpage on, generally refers to that ip.</p>
			<p>Lets cheat a little bit and add an ip we know is real to our code:</p>
<pre><code>def get_coords(ip):
	ip = &quot;4.2.2.2&quot;</code></pre>
			<p>We get <code>datastore_types.GeoPt(39.944, -105.062)</code> at the top.</p>
			<p>So, our <code>get_coords</code> function is working, and we tested the error case as well.</p></div>

			<p>Now, our Art object doesn't take any coordinates.</p>
			<p>So, lets add to our Art object:</p>
<pre><code>class Art(db.Model):

	art = db.TextProperty(required = True)
	created = db.DateTimeProperty(auto_now_add = True)

			<p>We aren't making coords required because the page already has art in it, and we don't want to wipe out our existing contributions.</p>
			<p>Now go back to the post function and replace <code># if we have coordinates, add them to the Art.</code> with:</p>
<pre><code>if coords:

		<h2>Stage 5.3 Recursion and Parallel Computing</h2>

		<div class="concept" id="stage-5-3-1">
			<div class="concept-title">Infinite Power</div>
			<div class="concept-content"><p>The big idea in this stage is recursive definitions. The real goal is to give you infinite power. But wait, we've had infinite power since stage 2, when we learned that with if, functions and arithmetic we could every possible computer program. We went on to introduce while, and that really should not have been necessary if you already had infinite power. What we're going to see in this unit is all you really need are procedures (functions) and that by thinking about things recursively you can solve lots of problems in interesting ways.</p></div>
		</div>

		<div class="concept" id="stage-5-3-2">
			<div class="concept-title">Long Words</div>
			<div class="concept-content"><p>What is the longest word in the English language?</p>
			<p>Is it hornorificabilititudinitatibus, antidisestablismentarianism, hippopotomonstrosequipedaliophobia pneumonoultramicrosopicsilicovolanoconiosis, or none of the above? The answer is none of the above. The reason is that whatever you claim is the longest word, you can always make a longer one. There is no such thing as the longest word in the English language.</p></div>
		</div>

		<div class="concept" id="stage-5-3-3">
			<div class="concept-title">Counter</div>
			<div class="concept-content"><p>A word is just something that has meaning, that speakers of the language will understand. We could define words as just what's in the dictionary and then there would be a clear answer to the longest word question. But, there are lots of things that are words that aren't in the dictionary. The important thing about words is we have rules for making new words.</p>
			<p>For example, we have a rule that says if we have a word, we can make a new word by adding counter- in front of the old word:</p>
			<p>Word --&gt; counter-Word. This is a Backus-Naur Form replacement grammar that we used in stage 2. The basic property is that we can replace what's on the left side with what's on the right side.</p>
			<p>Any time we have a word, we can replace it with counter-word, the meaning of the new word is &quot;something that goes against the original word.&quot;</p>
			<p>If we started with the word intellegence, (in the sense of spycraft,) we could use the rule and make the word counter-intelligence. We can use the rule again and make counter-counter-intelligence. We could keep doing that, we could have counter-counter-counter-intelligence, and so on.</p>
			<p>We could do this for other words, like hippopotomonstrosequipedaliophobia (fear of long words.) We can make the new word counter-hippopotomonstrosequipedaliophobia, and even though you've never seen the word before, you can guess that its something that goes against the fear of long words, like a new drug. You could also guess that counter-counter-hippopotomonstrosequipedaliophobia is something that counteracts the new drug.</p>
			<p>Because English has this rule that allows us to make new words from old words, there is no such thing as the longest word. We can always make a longer word starting from any word that we have.</p></div>
		</div>

		<div class="concept" id="stage-5-3-4">
			<div class="concept-title">Counter Quiz</div>
			<div class="concept-content"><p>If the only rule we have for making words is this one:</p>
			<p>Word --&gt; counter-Word</p>
			<p>How many words can we make, starting from the non-terminal Word?</p>
			<p>None, 1, 2, or Infinitely many?</p>
			<p>The answer is none.</p>
			<p>We can't make any words from this rule, because our definition is circular. If you remember BNF grammars, we can only stop once we have all terminals. This rule gives us no way to stop. We can keep adding more counter-s but, we'll never replace the non-terminal Word.</p></div>
		</div>

		<div class="concept" id="stage-5-3-5">
			<div class="concept-title">Expanding Our Grammar</div>
			<div class="concept-content"><p>Lets add one more rule.</p>
			<p>How many different words can we make starting from Word using only these two rules:</p>
			<p>Word --&gt; counter-Word</p>
			<p>Word --&gt; hippopotomonstrosequipedaliophobia</p>
			<p>How many words can we make?</p>
			<p>None, 1, 2, or Infinitely many?</p>
			<p>Now, the answer is infinitely many.</p>
			<p>This is the power that recursive definitions give us.</p>
			<p>Unlike the previous definition which was circular, what we have now is called a recursive definition. That means we've defined Word in terms of itself, but we have another rule that allows us to have a starting point. Using these two rules, there is no limit to the number of words we can produce.</p>
			<p>The important things that our definition has is a base case:  Word --&gt; hippopotomonstrosequipedaliophobia</p>
			<p>And, it has a recursive case: Word --&gt; counter-Word</p>
			<p>By combining those two, we have a definition that can make infinitely many words.</p></div>
		</div>

		<div class="concept" id="stage-5-3-6">
			<div class="concept-title">Recursive Definitions</div>
			<div class="concept-content"><p>This works for things other than words. The place where you've seen it the most so far has been in language. We're also going to see how to use it to make procedures. There are lots and lots of different things in computing that are defined recursively.</p>
			<p>A recursive definition has two parts:</p>
			<p>1. The base case. A starting point. The important thing about the base case is that its not defined in terms of itself. Its the smallest input that we already know the answer to.</p>
			<p>2. The recursive case. It is defined in terms of itself. Actually, defined in terms of a smaller version of itself. We need to make progress to eventually get to the base case.</p></div>
		</div>

		<div class="concept" id="stage-5-3-7">
			<div class="concept-title">Ancestors</div>
			<div class="concept-content"><p>Who are your ancestors?</p>
			<p>We have you, and your parents. But they aren't all of your ancestors. Your parents have parents as well. Your grandparents also had parents, your great-grandparents, and so on.</p>
			<p>All of these, except yourself, are your ancestors.</p>
			<p>Our goal is to define that precisely. Can we come up with a definition that describes preciesly all the ancestors that you have?</p>
			<p>The best definition of ancestors is:</p>
			<p>Ancestor --&gt; Parent</p>
			<p>Ancestor --&gt; Parent of Ancestor</p>
			<p>This is a recursive definition that works. It says our parent is our ancestor, and the parent of an ancestor is also an ancestor. This will give us exactly the set of ancestors that we talked about.</p></div>
		</div>

		<div class="concept" id="stage-5-3-8">
			<div class="concept-title">Recursive Procedures</div>
			<div class="concept-content"><p>Now we're going to see how to use recursive definitions to define a procedure.</p>
			<p>We're going to start by defining a factorial procedure. According to Wikipedia, the factorial of a non-negative integer n, denoted by n!, is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to n.</p>
			<p>factorial (n) = n * (n-1) * (n-2) * ... *1</p>
			<p>This definition is not very precise mathematically. The problem is the ... . Humans understand the ... correctly, but its not a very precise mathematical definition.</p>
			<p>If we use a recursive definition, we can define factorial in a much more precise way.</p>
			<p>We need to do that by giving a base case: For the base case, we want to think about the simplest input, something we already know the answer to. For factorial, the simplest input is the number zero. factorial (0) = 1. Thats going to be our base case.</p>
			<p>Now we need to define the recursive case: factorial (n) = n * factorial (n-1)</p></div>
		</div>

		<div class="concept" id="stage-5-3-9">
			<div class="concept-title">Recursive Factorial</div>
			<div class="concept-content"><p>Define a procedure, factorial, that takes a natural number as its input, and outputs the number of ways to arrange the input number of items.</p>
<pre><code>def factorial(n):
	if (n) == 0:

		return n * factorial(n-1)</code></pre>
			<p>We need to first check if we've reached the base case, so we use an <code>if</code> for that:</p>
<pre><code>	if (n) == 0:
		return 1</code></pre>
			<p>When <code>n</code> is not equal to 0, we use <code>else:</code> Then we have the recursive case:</p>

			<p>It may seem strange that we're defining <code>factorial</code> using <code>factorial</code>, it seems circular. The reason its not circular is we have our base case. We have a case where we do stop. Every time we call <code>factorial</code>, instead of passing in the same value of <code>n</code> that we started with, we're passing in <code>n-1</code>, eventually we're going to get to 0. We eventually stop, <code>return 1</code>, and on the way there, we're going to be multiplying in all these values.</p>
			<p>Lets step through what happens when we run this code. Suppose we called <code>factorial(3)</code>. We're going to enter the procedure, the value of <code>n</code> is going to be 3. <code>n</code> is not equal to 0, so we return the value of <code>n * factorial(n-1)</code>, so we're computing <code>3 * factorial(2)</code>. Now we're evaluating <code>factorial(2)</code>. We enter the procedure again, this time the value of <code>n</code> is 2. We do the comparison, <code>n</code> does not equal 0, so we go to the <code>else</code> clause and return <code>2 * factorial(1)</code>. We call <code>factorial</code> again with <code>factorial(1)</code>. We reenter <code>factorial</code>, but this time the value of <code>n</code> is 1. The <code>if</code> test is false, so now we're going to return the result of <code>1 * factorial(0)</code>. Now we call <code>factorial(0)</code>, now the value of <code>n</code> is 0. The test is true, so we <code>return 1</code>. That gives us the solution to all our return statements, which is 6.</p></div>

			<div class="concept-title">Palindromes</div>
			<div class="concept-content"><p>We're going to do another example of defining a recursive procedure. The goal this time is to take in a string and determine whether or not its a palindrome. A palindrome reads the same way forwards and backwards. An example of a palindrome would be the word level. If we read it forwards, we get level, if we read it backwards, we get exactly the same thing. Another example would be the word a. If we read it forwards or backwards, we get the same result. The empty string, <code>&quot;&quot;</code> is also a palindrome.</p>
			<p>Our goal is to define a procedure, that will take any string as input, and output <code>True</code> if that string is a palindrome.</p>
			<p>Define a procedure, <code>is_palindrome</code>, that takes as input a string, and outputs a boolean indicating if the input string is a palindrome.</p>
			<p>Some hints: Define what it means to be a palindrome. We should think about the base case: <code>&quot;&quot;</code> --&gt;<code>True</code>. What if the input is not an empty string? One way to solve that would be to look at the first letter and last letter of the string. If those are equal, it might be a palindrome, its a palindrome if all the letters left over in the middle are also a palindrome. So, here is how we can break the question of whether a string is a palindrome into smaller steps: Our recursive case is going to test the first and last character of the string, and see if those are equal, if the first and last characters don't match, we know the result is false. If they do match, we need to check to see if the middle of the string is a palindrome.</p>
<pre><code>def is_palindrome(s):
	if s == '':
		return True
	else:
		if s[0] == s[-1]:
			return is_palindrome(s[1:-1])
		else:
			return False</code></pre></div>

			<div class="concept-title">MapReduce</div>
			<div class="concept-content"><p>According to Wikipedia, MapReduce is a programming model and an associated implementation for processing and generating large data sets with a parallel, distributed algorithm on a cluster.</p>
			<p>Say you have a large file. Processing it serially could take a long time. Instead, MapReduce is designed to process data in parallel. So, your file is broken into chunks, and then processed in parallel. Lets look at a real world scenario.</p></div>
		</div>

		<div class="concept" id="stage-5-3-12">
			<div class="concept-title">Real World Example</div>
			<div class="concept-content"><p>Lets imagine we run a retailer, with thousands of stores around the world, and we have a big ledger that contains all of our sales. The Big Book O' Sales for the year 2012. We've been asked to calculate things like the total sales per store.</p>
			<p>Lets say the lines of the ledger look like this: The date of the purchase, the location of the store, what they bought, and the amount.</p>
			<p>One way we could do this is start at the beginning of the ledger, and for every entry, write down the store location and the amount. When we come to a store location again, update the amount by addition. Then we'd continue through the ledger.</p></div>
		</div>

		<div class="concept" id="stage-5-3-13">
			<div class="concept-title">Distributed Work</div>
			<div class="concept-content"><p>Rather than one person reading the entire ledger, say we had more people to help. We'll split them into two groups: The Mappers, and The Reducers.</p>
			<p>Then we'll take the ledger, break it into chunks and give each chunk to one of the mappers. That way each of the mappers can work at the same time, each over a small fraction of the data. The mappers would take each sale, and write the location of the store and the amount on an index card. As they write the index cards, they'll pile them up so cards from the same store are in the same pile. By the end, each mapper will have a pile of cards per store.</p>
			<p>Once the mappers have finished, the reducers can collect their sets of cards. We'll tell each reducer which store they're responsible for. The reducers go to the mappers and collect their respective piles of cards. Its fast because the mappers have already separated their cards. They amalgamate these piles. All they have to do at this point is add up all the amounts from all the cards in the pile. That gives them the total sales for that store. They can then write that amount on their final sheet. To keep things organized, each reducer goes through their piles in alphabetical order, in other words Los Angeles before Miami.</p></div>
		</div>

		<div class="concept" id="stage-5-3-14">
			<div class="concept-title">Summary of MapReduce</div>
			<div class="concept-content"><p>Thats how MapReduce works.</p>
			<p>The mappers are just little programs that each deal with a relatively small amount of data and work in parallel. We call their output intermediate records. Thats what we were writing on our index cards. It deals with all data in terms of (key, value), so these records are actually keys and values. In our example, the key was the store name and the value was the sale total for each particular piece of input.</p>
			<p>Once the mappers have finished, a phase of MapReduce called shuffle and sort takes place. The shuffle is the movement of the intermediate records from the mappers to the reducers. The sort is the fact that the reducers will organize the sets of records, in our case the piles of cards, into sorted order.</p>
			<p>Finally, each reducer works on one set of records at a time, or one pile of cards. It gets the key and then a list of all the values. In our case a store like New York City, and all the sales for that store. The reducer processes those values in some way, in our case we were adding up sales. Then it writes out the final results.</p></div>

		<h2>Stage 5.4 Solving Big Problems</h2>

		<div class="concept" id="stage-5-4-1">
			<div class="concept-title">Introduction</div>
			<div class="concept-content"><p>This lesson is taken from the Udacity course <a target="_blank" href="http://www.udacity.com/course/cs212">Design of Computer Programs</a>, taught by Peter Norvig. Its the sixth lesson in that course. I wholeheartedly encourage you to watch it yourself for additional insight. The course is free to sign up for and take through Udacity.</p>
			<p>In it, Peter writes a program to find the highest scoring play in a crossword tile game, like Scrabble or Words With Friends.</p>
			<p>Because the pace of the lesson is very high and the Python very advanced, the instructions implore us not to focus on the details of the code but on Peter's process, his approach to tackling a huge problem.</p>
			<p>So, for this lesson, I'm abandoning my usual detailed note taking and will convey my take on Peter's approach to solving big problems.</p></div>
		</div>

		<div class="concept" id="stage-5-4-1">
			<div class="concept-title">Solving Big Problems</div>
			<div class="concept-content"><p>Peter uses an approach that we learned in Stage 1, <a target="_blank" href="/stage1#stage-1-3-10">Code, Test &amp; Refine</a> and in Stage 2 <a target="_blank" href="/stage2#stage-2-7">How to Solve Problems</a>, but adapts it to solving a large problem.</p>
			<p>So, here is my take on Peter's process:</p>
			<p>First, he takes time to fully comprehend the problem and break it down into smaller parts, which he calls a &quot;concept inventory&quot;:</p>
			<p>board</p>
			<p>letters</p>
			<p>--words</p>
			<p>--hand</p>
			<p>legal play</p>
			<p>score</p>
			<p>--letters</p>
			<p>--play</p>
			<p>--bonus</p>
			<p>dictionary</p>
			<p>blank tiles</p>
			<p>Second, he goes through his list and figures out basically how to implement each of the ideas in the inventory, seeing if there are any difficulties or areas that might be hard to implement.</p>
			<p>board - 2d array, may need a 2nd board to account for bonus squares</p>
			<p>letters - str</p>
			<p>--words - str</p>
			<p>--hand - str</p>
			<p>legal play - function, plays will need a position, direction, and the word itself</p>
			<p>score - function</p>
			<p>--letters - dictionary {'Z': 10}</p>
			<p>--play - function</p>
			<p>--bonus - mapping of position on the board to DW, etc.</p>
			<p>dictionary - set(words)</p>
			<p>blank tiles - str, dealing with it will be an issue later. Not only do we have to try all possiblities for the letter, the scoring rules are different.</p>
			<p>Third, he assures himself that solving the problem is doable. He doesn't quite know how each solution will work, but nothing he sees is unsolvable.</p>
			<p>Fourth, he reminds himself and the audience of the notion of pacing. He isn't going to sit down for 20 minutes and solve the problem. Its going to have to be incrementally, where he sets intermediate goals along the way. Without that pacing, you can lose focus and get discouraged that there is so much to do. If you break the problem into bite-sized pieces, you can say &quot;I'm almost there&quot; and move on to the next part</p>
			<p>Fifth, he finds a logical place to start. In this case, he starts with finding legal words from a hand. He spends time using pen and paper to work out the problem before coding, making sure he has a full understanding of what is going on and how to implement it before actually using the editor.</p>
			<p>Sixth, he writes the code for that function. He's not quite satisfied with the function, but he moves on for the time being.</p>
			<p>Seventh, he writes tests for the function to see if its performing correctly. These tests will be important as he makes changes to the function later.</p>
			<p>Eighth, he refines his find legal words function by using the notion of prefixes (and tests that too.)</p>
			<p>Ninth, he finally refines his find legal words function to a form he is satisfied with (and tests it as well.)</p>
			<p>Tenth, he takes a pacing break to congratulate himself on his progress.</p>
			<p>Then, he repeats steps Five through Ten, finding the next logical place to start by going back to his concept inventory, coding, testing and refining until the program is complete.</p></div>
